    <h1>Hyung-nae Lee</h1>
    <h2 class="italic">Summary</h2>
    <p class="box">Recently moved to Seattle and looking for an entry level software
      engineer job. Being a self-directed learner, I enjoy being challenged.
      During my internship at Samsung in 2017, I successfully contributed to
      unit testing and build automation despite having lack of experience in
      the field and knowledge of C#. I studied C# and analyzed related open
      source programs during off duty hours and weekends to get ahead. <br>
      I’ve begun my pursuit for bachelor’s degree in Computer Science since 2016 so
      that I can forge a balanced view of Business and Engineering. Being exposed to
      the entirely new point of views and languages made me a person who can easily
      adapt to a multi-disciplinary environment.</p>
